Api_core
=======
Implemented based on [Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf](https://www.yeelight.com/download/Yeelight_Inter-Operation_Spec.pdf).

Raw JAVA implementation of all classes required to connect and parse data from devices.

This module is very light (only dependencies are JSON and null-safety annotations) and should be usable in non-android projects.

Import in **build.gradle** or **build.gradle.kts** (no need to import it explicitly when using **api_kotlin**):
```gradle
implementation("com.github.PPaszkiewicz.YeelightDeviceAPI:api_core:1.0.1")
```

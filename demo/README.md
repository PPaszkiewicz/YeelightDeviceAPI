Demo
==========

Demo app of **api_kotlin**.

Includes:

1. **Simple demo**: showcases ```YeelightActiveViewModel``` without extra code.

2. **Direct demo**: showcases how to create connection to a single device with known address.

3. **Live demo**: showcases ```YeelightActiveViewModel```.

4. **Auto demo**: showcases ```YeelightCustomViewModel``` backed by ```YeelightAutoConnection```.

5. **No scan demo**: similar to auto but does not automatically scan devices.

Note that it's possible this demo will not work properly on emulators due to port forwarding issues (broadcast/announcement 
packets will not be received). Recommend using physical device that connects to the same wifi as Yeelight devices.
